# Styleguides

## TL;DR - Absolute Minimum

- Use the `.sv` extension for SystemVerilog files and the `.svh` extension for SystemVerilog files that are `` `include``d.
- Use **only ASCII characters** with **Unix-style line endings** (i.e., LF aka `\n`).
- Wrap code at **100 characters per line**.
- Indent with **two spaces** per level. **Do not use tabs.**
- **Delete trailing whitespace** at the end of every line. **Delete trailing newlines** at the end of every file. **Every file ends with *exactly* one LF.**
- Use `begin` and `end` unless a statement fits on a single line. Put the **`begin` on the same line as the condition** and the **`end` on its own line** (where it may be followed by an `else`, see below).
- **Prefix module instances with `i_`**, e.g.: `i_prefetcher`.
- **Append the direction to port names: `_o`, `_i`, `_io`.**
- For **active-low signals** put an additional **`n`**: `n` for internal signals, `_no`, `_ni`, `_nio` for ports.
- Denote **output** of a **register** with **`_q`** and the **input** with **`_d`**. When pipelining a signal, append a number starting at 2, e.g., `_q2`.
- **All clock signals begin with `clk`.** The main system clock for a design is `clk`; the main clock input of a module is `clk_i`. All further clocks have a unique identifier appended (e.g., `clk_dram`) and all signals in that clock domain start with that identifier (e.g., `dram_addr`).
- **Avoid `defines` and `ifdefs` as much as possible.** Use parameters and packages instead.
- If one file deviates from this style but consistently uses a different style, stick to the other style unless you are changing almost all code of that file.

## Files and Project Structure

- Each repository must contain a License file indicating the License at use.
- Please link to this style guide if your project adheres to it.

## Coding Style

- Keep the files tidy. No superfluous line breaks, align ports on a common boundary.
- Name dedicated signals wiring `module foo` (output) with `module bar` (input) `signal_foo_bar`
- Use interfaces to connect component instances and *only* to connect instances. Do not perform logic operations on interface signals; various tools have bugs with it.
- Use a flat port list (i.e., no interfaces) for modules. When a module is a reusable unit and has ports that can be represented as interfaces, provide a wrapper named `module_name_wrap` that exposes interfaces and does *nothing* else than connecting interfaces to the corresponding ports.
- Do not put overly large comment headers. Nevertheless, try to structure your HDL code, e.g.:

    ```
    // ------------------------------------
    // CSR - Control and Status Registers
    // ------------------------------------
    ```

<!-- - Specify memory map and integration rules while coding, using the `crazy88` (TODO: Link to Documentation) syntax. -->
- Put `begin` statements on the same level as the block qualifier (K&R style), for example:

    ```verilog
    module A (
      input  logic flush_i,
      output logic stall_o
    );

      logic whatever_signal;

      always_comb begin
        stall_o = 1'b0;
        if (flush_i) begin
          // do some stuff here
          stall_o = 1'b1;
        end else if (whatever_signal) begin
          // do some other stuff
        end
      end
    endmodule
    ```
    > The rationale is that extra lines for `begin/else/end` carry no information at all. They even may prevent parts of the code to not have enough space on some screens. Process blocks on the other hand are more self-contained and multiple process blocks are not required to be visible at the same time.
    > The intention behind this is to keep code which is closely related together (like the code in an `always` block). It then should easily fit on a single screen.

- This also applies to `case` statements.  `begin` and `end` may be omitted iff the entire case item (i.e., the case expression and the statement) fits on a single line.  Use a consistent style within one `case` statement.

    ```verilog
    unique case (state_q)
      Idle: begin
        state_d = Something;
        valid_o = 1'b1;
      end
      Something: begin
        // Multiple lines of other assignments
        if (ready_i) begin
          state_d = Idle;
        end
      end
      default: begin
        state_d = Idle;
      end
    endcase
    ```

    ```verilog
    unique case (stride_i)
      2'd0: state_d = Idle;
      2'd1: state_d = Bubble;
      2'd2: state_d = Forward;
      2'd3: state_d = Hold;
    endcase
    ```

- Give generics a meaningful type e.g.: `parameter int unsigned AsidWidth = 1`. The default type is a signed integer which in most of the time does not make an awful lot of sense for hardware.

- Name `generate` blocks with `begin : gen_name`. Do not put the name of the generate into a comment after the end; that's redundant. Do not use the `generate` keyword; it's redundant. For example:

    ```verilog
    for (genvar i=0; i < 10; i++) begin : gen_ten_times
      // something to generate 10x
    end

    if (PARAM == 0) begin : gen_no_param
      // something
    end else begin : gen_param
      // something else
    end
    ```
    > This simplifies synthesis and back-end scripts significantly and make them more vendor independent.

-  Name enumerate types with a `_e` suffix and `structs` that are used as types with a `_t` suffix:

    ```verilog
    typedef enum logic [1:0] { PrivUser, PrivSupervisor, PrivMachine } priv_lvl_e;
    typedef struct packed {
      logic [1:0]  rw;
      priv_lvl_e   priv_lvl;
      logic  [7:0] address;
    } csr_addr_t;
    ```
    ```verilog
    module A (
      input csr_addr_t csr_addr_i
    );

      always_comb begin
        if (csr_addr_i.priv_lvl == PrivUser) begin
          // do something fancy with this signal
        end
      end
    endmodule
    ```

- Do not compare single-bit signals to `0` or `1`; that's redundant. Instead simply use the signal and unary logical negation, as in

    ```verilog
    if (valid_i && !ready_i) begin
      state_d = Stall;
    end
    ```

- Use *logical* operators in *conditional* statements and *bitwise* operators when assigning signals or ports. For example:

    ```verilog
    always_comb begin
      cnt_d = cnt_q;
      if (push && !full) begin
        cnt_d++;
      end
    end

    assign flush = pop & ~empty;
    ```

- Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to make your editor consistently apply a style:

    ```
    # top-most EditorConfig file
    root = true

    # Unix-style newlines with a newline ending every file
    [*]
    end_of_line = lf
    insert_final_newline = true
    trim_trailing_whitespace = true
    max_line_length = 100
    # 2 space indentation
    [*.{sv, svh, v, vhd}]
    indent_style = space
    indent_size = 2
    ```

    There are plug-ins for almost any sane editor. The same example `.editorconfig` can also be found in this repository.

## Git

- Do not push to master unless you are the owner (as in responsible) of a repository. If you want to contribute, create a branch and open a Pull Request.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
- Capitalize the subject line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Wrap the body at 72 characters.
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.

For a detailed why and how please refer to one of the multiple [resources](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) regarding git commit messages.

If you use `vi` for your commit message, consider to put the following snippet inside your `~/.vimrc`:

```
autocmd Filetype gitcommit setlocal spell textwidth=72s
```
